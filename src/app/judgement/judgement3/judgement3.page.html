      <p>Patna High Court • Labour Rights & Equal Remuneration</p>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Meena Devi, an unorganized sector worker, filed a writ petition alleging gender-based pay discrimination in a government sanitation project.
        The case questioned the State’s compliance with the <strong>Equal Remuneration Act, 1976</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>Issues Raised</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether the government can outsource work without ensuring pay parity.</li>
        <li>Whether contractual women workers are entitled to minimum wage equivalence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Judgment</h3>
      <p>
        The Patna High Court ruled in favour of Meena Devi, holding that both male and female workers performing identical work must be paid equally. 
        It directed the State to regularize pay scales and establish grievance redressal cells for contract workers.
      </p>

      <h3>Significance</h3>
      <p>
        The ruling reinforced gender equity in public employment and expanded protections for informal workers — a major stride for inclusive labour justice.
