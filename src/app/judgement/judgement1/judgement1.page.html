      <ion-card-title>State of Bihar v. Bal Mukund Shah (2023)</ion-card-title>
      <p>Supreme Court of India • Article 21 – Fair Trial & Personal Liberty</p>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The case arose when Bal Mukund Shah, a small business owner from Patna, was detained without formal charge for over six months under preventive custody during an ongoing investigation.
        He claimed that his prolonged detention violated his fundamental right to life and personal liberty under <strong>Article 21</strong> of the Constitution.
      </p>

      <h3>Issues Raised</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether preventive detention beyond statutory limits violates Article 21.</li>
        <li>Whether failure to provide reasons for continued detention constitutes denial of a fair trial.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Judgment</h3>
      <p>
        The Supreme Court held that the State had violated the petitioner’s right to personal liberty by keeping him in custody without timely review. 
        The Court emphasized that liberty cannot be suspended merely on administrative convenience and directed the immediate release of the petitioner.
      </p>

      <h3>Significance</h3>
      <p>
        This judgment reaffirmed that any restriction on personal liberty must be narrowly interpreted, and the “right to fair trial” includes not just trial proceedings but also pre-trial fairness.
