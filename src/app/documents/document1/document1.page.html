      <p>Delhi High Court • Criminal Law – Unlawful Detention</p>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Rahul Singh</strong> was accused of participating in a public protest that turned violent. 
        He was detained by the Delhi Police without a warrant and was held for 72 hours before being presented 
        before a magistrate. His counsel argued that this was a violation of <strong>Article 22(2)</strong> of the Constitution.
      </p>

      <h3>Issues Raised</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether detention without a warrant violates Article 22(2) and the Code of Criminal Procedure.</li>
        <li>Whether the protest activity constituted a cognizable offense warranting immediate arrest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Judgment</h3>
      <p>
        The Delhi High Court ruled that the police failed to justify the extended detention 
        without producing Rahul Singh before a magistrate within the constitutional timeframe. 
        The Court ordered disciplinary proceedings against the officers involved and awarded 
        compensation to the petitioner.
      </p>

      <h3>Significance</h3>
      <p>
        This judgment reaffirmed the inviolability of the right to personal liberty and due process, 
        reiterating that even preventive actions must comply strictly with constitutional safeguards.
