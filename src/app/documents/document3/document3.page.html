      <p>Bangalore Civil Court • Employment Contract & Wrongful Termination</p>
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The case was filed by <strong>Nina Patel</strong>, a senior software engineer, against her former employer 
        <strong>ABC Pvt. Ltd.</strong> for wrongful termination and withholding of pending salary. 
        She argued that her dismissal violated the terms of her employment contract and 
        constituted workplace discrimination.
      </p>

      <h3>Issues Raised</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether the termination violated the contractual notice clause.</li>
        <li>Whether non-payment of dues amounts to a breach of the Employment Act, 1948.</li>
        <li>Whether the internal investigation procedure followed was legally valid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Judgment</h3>
      <p>
        The Court found that <strong>ABC Pvt. Ltd.</strong> failed to provide valid reasons or sufficient notice for the termination. 
        It directed the company to compensate the petitioner with six months’ salary and a written apology, 
        citing procedural lapses and bias in the internal review process.
      </p>

      <h3>Significance</h3>
      <p>
        The ruling underscores the importance of procedural fairness in employee termination and reaffirms 
        the protection of workers against arbitrary dismissal under employment law.
